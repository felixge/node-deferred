# Dojo deferreds as a nodejs module

**!! Work in Progress !!**

I am working on porting dojo deferreds as a nodejs module. The current state is that I have the dojo Deferred implementation working, but its still tied to dojo itself.

If you are interested in working on the port, please let me know to avoid duplicate efforts.
